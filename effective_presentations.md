Notes on [The Art of Public Speaking and Effective Presentations](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/public-speaking-effective-presentations) by [John Papa](http://www.johnpapa.net/)

## Tell a Story

- Focus on your main message
  - Discover your message and it will be received.
  - Reflect on what inspired you to do the presentation.
  - Everything you do and say should point back to the main message.
  - Your message should be simple, and instantly resonate with your audience.
  - Picture your average user.
- What's in it for me?
- Not too deep into technical details
- Inspire and motivate your audience.
 
## Creating Your Message

- Your message should answer:
    - What's in it for me? What skill am I gaining?
    - What's interesting to your audience?
    - Can I relate to it?
    - Why is it important **now**?
    - What's the identifiable skill?
    - What's special about your message?
    - Can I instantly relate to your message?

Simple, Compelling, Relatable (apply it now), Interesting
 
Example (long):
> "Learn how to choose a JavaScript framework such as Durandal or Angular that  
> scales and works well with others"

Example (short):
> "Get up to speed on Single Page Applications in 60 minutes"

There is only **ONE** most important message.

*In writing, you must kill all your darlings*:
  
- Facts and details have to support the main message.
- Cute anecdotes, if they support your message, keep them. If not, get rid of them.
- Find and stick with the core message.

You may say, "I have too much information!"

- What's not important?
- Does it reinforce the main message?
- Cut great material if it's too long
